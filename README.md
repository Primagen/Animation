Animation
============

The beginnings of a program used for the purpose of making animations.<br>
Concentration on vector graphic rendering for the moment.<br>
Currently uses the LodePNG library to handle PNG encoding and decoding.<br>
Currently renders hundreds of frames that then can be compiled into a video using external programs/libraries.<br>
Probably will add JPEG support for faster rendering<br>
Will upload more stuff later...<br>
Thank you, cplusplus.com<br>
